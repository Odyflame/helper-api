1
00:00:01,158 --> 00:00:01,805
좋아

2
00:00:03,106 --> 00:00:04,830
어디까지 얘기했지?  그날은 2007년 6월이었어

3
00:00:07,178 --> 00:00:10,109
인생은 기대하지 않았던 변환점을 맞았지  아빠 그냥 바로 엄마를 만난 부분으로 넘어가면 안돼요?

4
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,052
얘기를 1년은 하신것 같아요  얘야, 내가 하는 모든 얘기는 다 중요하단다

5
00:00:16,693 --> 00:00:19,572
모든 얘기가 이야기의 한 부분이야  - 아빠 화장실 가도 될까요? - 안돼

6
00:00:24,251 --> 00:00:25,932
2006년의 여름은 멋진 동시에 끔찍했지  나에겐 좋게 시작되었어

7
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:30,974
사실은 첫날은 정말 놀라웠지  난 마침내 로빈과 함께 하게 되었어

8
00:00:34,753 --> 00:00:41,960
내가 내 인생의 최고로 멋진 밤을 보내고 있을때  너희 삼촌 마샬은 최악의 밤을 겪었지

9
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:50,248
- 그거야? 우린 헤어지는거야? - 마샬, 미안해, 난...  난 샌프란시스코로 가서 이 미술 프로그램을 하고..

10
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:56,996
우리 사이가 아닌 나 자신이 누군지 알아야겠어  그렇게 할 유일한 방법은

11
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:01,800
서로 잠시 연락을 안하면 좋겠어  잠시만?

12
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:06,736
평생은 어때?  니가 저 문을 나서면, 우린 끝이야

13
00:01:09,493 --> 00:01:12,368
넌 평생 내 목소리를 못듣게 될거야  - 전화해야 겠어 - 안돼!

14
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:16,726
릴리가 그러지 말라고 했는데 전화하면  약해 보일뿐 아니라 후회하게 될거야

15
00:01:18,156 --> 00:01:20,419
있지, 전화하고 싶어지면  날 먼저 찾아와

16
00:01:23,346 --> 00:01:26,698
내가 니 얼굴 한방 먹여줄 테니까  넌 좋은 친구야, 테드

17
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:32,757
안녕, 그럼 그 뉴스 들었어?  니말은 릴리랑 마샬이 헤어지고 나서 릴리는 떠났고

18
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:36,999
어젯밤에 어떤 조금이라도 중요한 일이 일어나지 않았다는거?  응, 잘 알거야

19
00:01:42,526 --> 00:01:46,767
어머! 정말 유감스럽다, 무슨 일이야?  릴리는 떠났고, 돌아오긴 할건지도 모르겠어

20
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:50,965
일어나서야 니 메세지 봤어  친구, 유감스럽다

21
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:55,800
정말 힘들겠는걸  내가 니 기분이 좋아질 뿐 아니라

22
00:01:59,372 --> 00:02:06,389
적극적으로 흥분할 만한 얘기 해줄까? / 물론  역사상 처음으로 우리 세명은 동시에 싱글이야

23
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:13,631
난 이 날을 꿈꿔왔어 친구들 우린 이제 전설적이 될거야  우리 함께 이 도시를 차지할거야

24
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:28,100
언제든 한 여자가 예전 남친에게 앙갚음하고 싶으면 우리가 곁에 있어줄거야  언제든 한 여자가 아빠 문제를 마시고 떠들기로 푼다면 우리가 곁에 있어줄거야

25
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:39,576
언제든, 처녀 파티때 리무진을 타고 가다가 천장 지붕으로 머리를 들고 '뉴욕 잘 지내요!' 할때  우리는 그 '잘 된 뉴욕'이 될거야

26
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:49,831
신사분들, 우리는 이제...  이 놈들, 너희 했구나

27
00:02:59,253 --> 00:03:05,050
How I Met Your Mother 2x01   번역: 박은희 (네이트 24 자유제작)

28
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:12,629
그 해 여름에 알게 된 한가지는  사랑이 시작되고, 사랑이 끝날 때

29
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:23,735
초기의 30일은 둘이 놀랍게도 비슷하지  한가지는, 둘다 침대에서 대부분 시간을 보낸단 거고

30
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:43,646
친구들은 너희 얘기를 견딜 수 없어하지  그리고 넌 바지를 잘 안 입게 되지

31
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:48,104
안녕 마샬 / 안녕 테드  배고프냐?

32
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:55,837
그래 뭘 먹을순 있겠지 그럼 날 그냥 살려둘거야  적어도 그 시나리오에선 니가 버리는 걸 하든데

33
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,612
오늘은 일요일이야 팬케이크의 날이라구  릴리가 팬케이크를 만들어줬었는데

34
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,287
니 팬케이크가 너무 좋아 정말 부드럽고, 정말 따뜻하고  정말 완벽한 모양의..

35
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:15,782
우리 그 팬케이크 얘기하는 거 맞아?  넌 뭘 먹어야 해, 뭐 갖다줄까? / 맥주?

36
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:23,823
아니 그거 어제 저녁으로 먹었잖아 / 알았어  나한테 남은게 있을거야

37
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,396
내내 집에만 있으면서 얻어보려 노력하지도 않는다고?  아니다, 니가 약혼자가 있을때 하는 짓이 그거지

38
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,213
여기 내려와서 축하해야지  마샬한텐 그 빨강머리 종양이 제거된거야

39
00:04:39,523 --> 00:04:40,862
너 어린이용 책을 써야겠다  마샬이 뭘 해야될줄 알아?

40
00:04:43,744 --> 00:04:48,133
마샬은 슬퍼하는 걸 멈춰야 해  내가 슬퍼질때 난 슬픈걸 멈추고 더 끝내주게 변했지

41
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,121
사실이야  겨우 한달밖에 안됐어

42
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,668
예전의 마샬로 돌아올 필요가 있어  - 어쨌든, 릴리가 이 난잡의 원인인걸 - 왜 이래 릴리도 좀 이해해줘봐

43
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:01,897
릴리도 우리 친구잖아 릴리는 자신이 누구인질 찾는중이야  자기가 누구인지?

44
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:06,197
나한테 전화하라 그래 내가 적어놨으니까  릴리는 이기적인데다가, 미숙하고

45
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:26,850
그리고... / 왜?  이런, 니 눈 정말 파랗다 / 테디 베어..

46
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,482
너무 유감스러워 하기도 힘들었지  나는 내 꿈의 여자와 사귀고 있었고, 잘 되갔으니깐

47
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:37,608
대부분은 그랬지  릴리 샴푸를 발견했어 그래 놓고갔어

48
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:53,347
릴리 냄새가 난다.. 라벤더 향과 조개껍질과 희망...  어쩐지 이국적이고 편안한 냄새가 동시에 느껴져

49
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:03,051
그거 내 샴푸야 / 미안  마샬이 안 잘줄 알았어 / 이런

50
00:06:06,214 --> 00:06:08,622
벌써?  전화한다

51
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:12,733
마샬이 전화해! / 안들리는데  안 돼!

52
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:21,775
알았어! 안할게, 전화 안할거야  글쎄 내가 전화를 했는데 이걸 받았어

53
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:27,916
전화번호를 바꿨데  뭐 내가 스토커라도 되고 릴리는 너무 특별하셔?

54
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:37,958
거기 있는 유일한 한명인줄 아는데 샌프란시스코에만 릴리가 4명이 있어  그리고 같이 변태적 얘기를 나눠보니 다들 더 낫아보이던데?

55
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:43,457
내가 여기 있는거 알아? / 그래 안녕 로빈  이젠 그만 둬야 해

56
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:47,095
테드, 우린 데이트를 막 시작했어  우리 너무 성급히 굴지 말자고 동의했는데

57
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,856
웬일인지 우리한테는 애가 있는거야  밥도 혼자 못먹고, 많이 울고 밤새 깨어있고..

58
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:00,360
모유 수유는 시도해봤냐? 성공했어!  걔네는 9년동안 함께했어 아직 1개월 반밖에 안됐는걸

59
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,546
원래 페이스로 돌아올 시간이 필요해  어제 우리 바닥에서 잤다니깐

60
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:08,716
'무서운 영화'를 봤다구  이젠 엄한 태도를 취해야겠어

61
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,866
아파트에서 나오게 할 필요가 있어  마샬한텐 신선한 공기가 필요해

62
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:15,842
햇빛도 필요하구  음.. 햇빛(sunshine)이라..

63
00:07:23,884 --> 00:07:26,769
신사 여러분.. '선샤인'양을 무대로 환영해 주십시오!  바니, 진짜 이게 도움이 될 것 같진 않다

64
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:31,310
왜 아직도 릴리를 극복 못한줄 알아?  바로 니가 아직도 릴리의 벗은 몸을 상상할수 있어서야

65
00:07:34,424 --> 00:07:36,064
넌 그녀 가슴을 그만 생각하기 전까진 여자를 잊을 수 없다구  과학적 사실이야

66
00:07:42,392 --> 00:07:46,575
평균의 남자의 뇌는 꽤 괜찮은 가슴 사진을 한정되게 저장해놓는다는 거야  니 하드엔 지금 릴리 껄로 꽉 차있는거 알아

67
00:07:48,544 --> 00:07:52,915
정말 많이 들어있어  다른 여자 가슴 이미지로 덮어쓰기 전에는 극복하지 못해

68
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:00,279
이번 여행은 몇백만개의 가슴을 거치게 되겠지만  우린 여기서 시작할거야 친구, 한번에 둘 씩..

69
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:13,484
저건 넷으로 세야겠구나  재미있지, 밖에 나오니 날씨 좋지? 인디언스 팀은 구려요!

70
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,581
정말 나오니까 날씨 좋다   * 양키 팀 팬분들 야구장 스크린을 보시면서 *

71
00:08:30,403 --> 00:08:32,575
* 깜짝 프로포즈를 하는 커플을 축하해주세요 *  모두 다 거짓말이야!

72
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:41,301
곧 니 마음을 아프게 할거라구!  우린 다 해봤어

73
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:46,897
야구장, 스트리퍼 팬케이크도 안먹겠데잖아  회복의 가망이 없는 것 같아

74
00:08:48,453 --> 00:08:50,202
봤지? 이게 남자들의 문제점이야  실연의 비탄을 어떻게 대처할줄 모르지

75
00:08:52,947 --> 00:09:02,574
그럼 처방전이 뭡니까? 에스트로겐 박사님?  하겐다즈 먹으면서 그날 끝날때까지 '러브 액츄얼리'보기?

76
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:07,986
그래, 그거였어  와, 언제부터 한거야?

77
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:12,943
어릴때 아빠가 가르쳐줬어  내가 외롭거나 우울할때 여기 오면

78
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,647
총도.. 재미있단걸 상기하지  있지? 테드는 총을 반대하는 타입이야

79
00:09:27,018 --> 00:09:30,545
그래서 테드는 절대 알면 안돼  내가 총 들고 있는 거 무섭구나?

80
00:09:33,187 --> 00:09:35,148
아니 내 말은.. 테드한테 말하지 마  너도 해볼래?

81
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:38,563
당근이지  오 예

82
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,980
이게 필요했어  정말 무기력했는데

83
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:52,218
이건.. 정말 힘이 생겨!  총포의 반동이 일어나단건 알려줬어야 했는데

84
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:56,812
알려줘야 겠어, 마샬은 집에 와서 미소를 짓더라  같이 잤어?

85
00:09:59,537 --> 00:10:02,303
사실 그걸 제안했던게 3일 전이었거든  가끔 넌 여성적인 면을 건드려주기만 하면 돼

86
00:10:07,582 --> 00:10:10,897
하하, 호호, 예예!  그럼, 축하해 넌 마샬의 여름을 기분좋게 만들어준 첫번째 사람이야

87
00:10:11,803 --> 00:10:14,912
니가 이겼어  뭘 이겼는데? / 뭔지 알아? 이번 주말에 어디 데려갈거야

88
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,560
정말? 좋은데?  이모랑 삼촌의 몬타그 해변가에 별장을 가지고계신데 정말 로맨틱해

89
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:27,712
우리 삼촌은 거기서 세번이나 불륜을 저지르셨데  와, 정말 좋은 장소인가 봐? 너희 삼촌 사진을 봤거든

90
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,273
정말 로맨틱하겠는데 마침내 우리 둘만의 시간을 보내고..  마샬도 괜찮을것 같아?

91
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:36,744
당근이지, 친구  난 훨씬 좋아졌어

92
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:43,562
- 그냥, 내 차도 갖구 가 - 정말? 고마워  그리고 뭐 필요하면 낮이든 밤이든 전화만 줘

93
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:50,603
있지? 절대 나한테 전화하지 마  왜? 뭐가 문제야? / 이거 릴리 신용카드 청구서야

94
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:57,504
주소를 바꾸는 걸 깜박했나봐 / 그래서?  샌프란시스코 어디서 무슨 돈을 썼을까?

95
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:03,362
안돼, 이걸 보면 기분만 안좋아져  너 이미 향상되고 있다구, 안돼

96
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:11,433
이건 나한테 고마워 해  넌 좋은 친구야 테드

97
00:11:14,864 --> 00:11:18,066
8월 5일 한 번, 티켓 무슨 티켓?  조지 클린튼과 피 펑크 얼스타스 (* George Clinton & P.Funk Stars)

98
00:11:21,302 --> 00:11:29,927
8월 10일 한 번 테니스 백화점에서  8월 18일 두 번, 마리오 술집 에다가 이거 봐, 펫 팔라스

99
00:11:34,168 --> 00:11:39,927
무슨 뜻인지 몰라?  와 마리오 술집이라니 바람피고 다니기 완벽한 장소군요

100
00:11:43,098 --> 00:11:47,719
제 귀여운 릴리 씨를 위하면 뭐든지 다 하지요  펑크의 전설 조지 클린튼씨 절 콘서트에서 발견하시곤

101
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:55,590
무대로 올리셔서 커트니콕스 스타일로 같이 춤추게 해주신거 고마워요  같이 테니스 쳐준거 고맙소

102
00:11:59,087 --> 00:12:03,325
마샬은 9년간 같이 테니스 치자고 했었는데  전 안쳤어요, 왜냐면 전 마샬을 정말로 사랑하지 않았거든요

103
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:12,872
선물도 가져왔소  흰족제비요? 좀 있다 '펫 팔라스'에서 모이를 사줘야 겠네요

104
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:18,120
전 항상 하나를 기르고 싶었어요  마샬은 남 몰래 족제비혐오증이 있었거든요

105
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:24,470
그건 아무한테 말하지 말라고 했던 비밀이었나 본데요  네 맞아요

106
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:29,225
사랑해요 펑크의 전설 조지 클린튼씨  나도 사랑하오, 릴리

107
00:12:32,023 --> 00:12:37,455
맞소 마샬 릴리는 내꺼요  이제 내 머리를 갖고 놀게도 해줄거요

108
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:41,965
여태껏 들어본 얘기중에 정말 미친 소리다  그래 왜 족제비를 싫어해? 귀엽잖아

109
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,383
왜냐면 로빈, 걔네는 복슬하게 부풀은 쥐 같잖아  이 청구서는 한 달 전 쯤에 쓴거잖아 / 내 말이

110
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:55,990
최근 청구 내역은 온라인 계좌를 확인해봐야 할걸  너 2시간 전 쯤.. 신용카드 내역도 볼수 있을걸?

111
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:03,898
근데 있지.. 그러진 마  왜 얘기 했어! 왜 얘기 했냐고!

112
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:08,290
비밀번호가 필요해, 마샬은 모를껄  비밀번호를 알았군

113
00:13:13,784 --> 00:13:20,310
오늘 아침에 5가에 있는 켈렛 호텔에서 썼어  못믿겠어, 릴리가 뉴욕에 돌아와있는거야

114
00:13:24,308 --> 00:13:28,101
믿을 수 없군, 릴리가 뉴욕에 다시 와있어?  난 릴리가 돌아오면 전화 줄거라 생각했어

115
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:34,065
그게 여지껏 여름 내내 내가 정신을 차린 이유였는데  이게 '정신 차리기'였어?

116
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,910
있지? 전화할래 / 안돼  넌 전화 못해 그런다구 바뀌지 않아

117
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:42,267
너 일루 와  있지, 우리가 주말에 놀아가면

118
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:46,319
너 마샬 내내 감시하면서 호텔에 전화 안하나 확인할래?  뭐 애를 돌보라고?

119
00:13:48,504 --> 00:13:50,042
한시간당 20달러  그리고 피자 먹을 돈도 추가

120
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:53,599
그래 공짜로 해주지 않으면  매번 우리랑 같이 놀때 이걸 보는건 어때?

121
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:01,597
- 이리와, 내 귀여운 파란 눈 - 오 우 슈가슈가  알았어, 할게, 커플짓 그만해

122
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:08,738
마샬!  테드, 어쩔수 없었어! 우린 9년간 함께했는데 여태껏 했던 모든게 헛수고..

123
00:14:11,655 --> 00:14:13,551
안녕하세요 릴리 씨 방 연결해주세요  고맙습니다

124
00:14:17,142 --> 00:14:24,272
테드 못 끊어 / 끊어! 지금 끊어! 끊으라구!  네?

125
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:30,505
남자가 받았어  방에 남자가 있어

126
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,499
거기 가봐야 겠어  거기 내려가서 내가 사랑한다고 말하고

127
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,552
날 다시 받아달라고 빌어야 겠어  안돼면 무릎도 꿇어볼꺼야

128
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:43,424
마샬 그럴 순 없어 / 정말? 왜 안돼는데?  57일째, 내가 똑바로 말하게 되는데 걸린 시간이지

129
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:50,622
왜냐면 넌 불쌍해 보이니깐!  미안해, 하지만 넌 지금 마샬이 아니야

130
00:14:55,492 --> 00:14:59,056
너는 불쌍하게, 흐느끼는 샴푸 냄새를 맡는 마샬의 유령이야  솔직히, 너같은 남자는 릴리같은 여자때문에 별걸 시도하지 않아

131
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,717
확실히 시도해 봐야 하는게 누구 인 줄이나 알아?  마샬, 진짜 마샬이야

132
00:15:06,718 --> 00:15:10,285
니가 지금 거기로 내려간다면  넌 진짜 마샬한텐 큰 실수만 안겨 줄거고 용서도 안해줄거야

133
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:13,571
어쨌든 내가 뭘 말하든지 넌 반대로 하겠지  그럼.. 좋은 주말 보내

134
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,775
니 인생 잘 망쳐봐  이리와 로빈

135
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:30,744
우리 아직도 차 빌릴수 있는거지?  뻔뻔하군, 차 빌리는것 땜에 뻔뻔해져

136
00:15:34,228 --> 00:15:37,546
왜? / 난 아무 말 안했어  - 내가 너무했다 생각하지? - 난 아무말 안했다구

137
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:41,504
날 너무하다고 비난할 줄 몰랐어  니가 먼저 엄한 태도를 취하자며

138
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:46,731
그래 엄한 태도를 말했지 올가미를 씌우란건 아니었어  9미리(권총)를 건네주는건 괜찮다?

139
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:55,273
그래.. 말해줬어  - 그럼 너 총신도구나? - 아니 난 총 애호가야

140
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,310
- 너 매년 얼마나 많은 사람이 매년 죽음을 - 헌법 수정 제2조에선 무장 권리를..  좋아 좋아 알았어

141
00:16:07,236 --> 00:16:10,177
내가 너무했어  바니한테 어떻게 됐나 전화해보자

142
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:12,579
바니입니다  어디있어?

143
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:16,234
모금 행사중이야  어린 여학생들이 전문대 갈 학자금을 모으는 걸 돕고있지

144
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,996
스크립 클럽이구나? 멋진데 마샬 괜찮아?  응 여기 있어 좋아

145
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,705
마샬 테드한테..  벌써에요?

146
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,562
마샬은 갔어 / 놓쳤어?  이럴수가, 마샬은 호텔로 쫓아갈거야

147
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:46,561
이런, 좋아, 계획이 있어 넌 호텔에 가서 마샬을 찾고  난 여기서 랩댄스를 받고 있지 3시부터..

148
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:59,392
- 너희 삼촌 별장에 온수욕조 있어? - 정말 좋은 거 하나 있지  릴리 씨 방이 어딘줄 아세요?

149
00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:06,686
마샬 / 안녕  어떻게 됐어?

150
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,765
난 릴리 층에 올라갔는데  머릿속에 말할 내용을 생각하고 있었어

151
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:15,657
여름내내 릴리한테 얘기하고 싶었던 것들  사랑과, 충직과, 존중...

152
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:25,834
내가 문을 두드렸을때  그럼 릴리 새 남친을 때려눕혔다고?

153
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,064
응, 릴리 남친이 아니었어  그럼 누군데?

154
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,768
조이 애달리언이었어  비록 그는 신분 위장 절도를 위해 몇년간 여러 가명을 쓰고 다녔지

155
00:17:40,117 --> 00:17:41,645
사실은, 여름 초에..  정말 부끄럽네요

156
00:17:44,778 --> 00:17:47,190
제가 잔돈을 가져왔을것 같은데..  알아요, 죄송해요

157
00:17:51,358 --> 00:17:55,849
오 여깄네요, 아 이건 단추였네요  단추였어요

158
00:17:59,785 --> 00:18:01,953
신용카드도 받나요? / 물론이죠  그럼 릴리는 우리 동네에 온게 아니네

159
00:18:08,893 --> 00:18:13,422
남자친구도 없고 그럼 좋은거지? / 그래  그 신용카드 내역이 나한텐 유일하게 남은 연락처였어

160
00:18:17,382 --> 00:18:25,504
어디있는지, 뭘 하는 지 몰라  릴리는 내 삶의 전부였다구 친구 근데 떠났으니..

161
00:18:27,277 --> 00:18:30,131
대학교 첫날  난 나타나서 정말 긴장해서

162
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,199
내 방에 올라 갔는데 거기 내 룸메이트가 있었어  침대에 누워서 발은 벽에 올리고 헤드폰을 끼고

163
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:46,710
아무것도 신경 안쓴다는 미소를 지었지..  행복해 보였고, 자신감 있고, 뭐든 두려워 보이지 않았어

164
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:53,026
그 남자애는 바로 너였어  릴리를 만나기 바로 전의 너

165
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:58,446
있지 / 응?  나 그날 취했어

166
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:09,160
정말이야 너무 취해서 니가 학장인줄 알았어  내말은 릴리 없는 너만의 버전이 있어

167
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:18,403
그건 이런 모습이 아냐  그 남자가 릴리 신분을 훔친것처럼 니가 릴리한테 신분을 빼앗기면 안돼

168
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:21,466
알았어  좋아

169
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:26,863
해결했어  내일부터, 난 괜찮아 질거야

170
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:37,728
건배 / 건배  하지만 괜찮아지지 않았지

171
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:47,030
인생은 그렇게 쉽게 풀리지 않거든  다음날 양말같은걸 찾아서는 우리는 처음으로 되돌아갔지

172
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:51,776
그러다가는 어느날 아침..  테드, 이거 봐야겠어

173
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:55,911
뭔데?  마샬?

174
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,813
너 뭐해?  일요일이잖아

175
00:20:06,394 --> 00:20:19,480
팬케이크 먹는 날이잖아  67일 하고도 정말 구역질나게 맛없는 팬케이크가 들었어

176
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:25,356
마샬은 죽음에서 돌아왔지  왜냐면 야구장이나 스트리퍼나 총이 도울수 있을지 몰라도

177
00:20:31,356 --> 00:00:00,667
실연의 애탄을 정말 치료해줄 수 있는 유일한 건.. 시간이야

178
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:02,200
TED: Okay where were we?

179
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:04,567
It was June of 2006,

180
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:06,400
and life had just taken an unexpected turn.

181
00:00:07,968 --> 00:00:08,033
Dad, can't you just skip ahead

182
00:00:09,501 --> 00:00:09,567
to the part where you meet Mom?

183
00:00:11,634 --> 00:00:11,701
I feel like you've been talking for like a year.

184
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:14,334
Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important.

185
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:15,868
It's all part of the story.

186
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:17,200
Could I go to the bathroom?

187
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:18,634
No.

188
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:22,868
The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful.

189
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:25,534
For me, it started out great.

190
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,167
In fact, day one was amazing.

191
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:31,234
I'd finally gotten together   with Robin.

192
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:32,767
But while I'd been off having   one of the best nights

193
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:35,033
of my life, your uncle Marshall

194
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,067
had been having one   of the worst nights of his.

195
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:40,834
* Crying in the street... *

196
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:41,868
MARSHALL:  So that's it?

197
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:43,868
We're breaking up?

198
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:45,667
Marshall, I'm sorry. I just...

199
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:47,200
I just need to go

200
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,167
to San Francisco and do this art program and-and figure out

201
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:52,334
who I am outside of us.

202
00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:54,000
And the only way

203
00:00:58,701 --> 00:00:58,767
that I can do that is if... if we don't talk for a while.

204
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:00,767
For a while.

205
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,167
Try never, okay?

206
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:05,901
You walk out that door, and we're done.

207
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:08,434
You're never going to hear my voice again.

208
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:09,901
I should call her. No, No.

209
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:11,901
Ted it is-- If you call her

210
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:13,701
when she asked you not to you're just going to look weak

211
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:15,133
and you're going to regret it.

212
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:17,434
Now, listen, whenever you feel like calling her,

213
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:19,000
you come find me first.

214
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:22,300
And I will punch you in the face.

215
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:23,667
You're a good friend, Ted.

216
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:26,100
(knock at door)

217
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:27,334
Hey.

218
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:28,767
So, did you hear the big news?

219
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:30,968
You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up,

220
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:33,033
and Lily's gone and nothing else

221
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:34,567
even remotely important happened last night,

222
00:01:35,634 --> 00:01:35,701
yeah, I think he knows.

223
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:37,467
Oh, my God.

224
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:39,868
I-I'm so sorry. Wh--

225
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:40,934
What happened?

226
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:42,868
Well, she left.

227
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:45,934
And I don't even know if she's coming back.

228
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:47,434
I didn't get your message until I woke up.

229
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:49,334
Bro, I am so sorry.

230
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:50,367
Thanks.

231
00:01:51,734 --> 00:01:51,801
I know it must be tough,

232
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:53,300
but are you ready to hear something

233
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:54,934
that will not only make you feel better,

234
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:56,701
but will actively excite you?

235
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,367
Sure.

236
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:02,801
For the first time, ever,  the three of us are single

237
00:02:04,234 --> 00:02:04,300
at the same time.

238
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:07,033
I've dreamed about this day, boys,

239
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:08,334
and it's going to be

240
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:09,734
legendary.

241
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:12,834
Together, we will own this city.

242
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:16,834
Anytime a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriends,

243
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:18,767
we'll be there.

244
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:22,567
Anytime a girl wants to solve her father issues

245
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,467
through promiscuity and binge drinking, we will be there.

246
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:30,434
Anytime a bachelorette party drives through the city

247
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:32,901
in a limo, sticking their heads out the sunroof shouting,

248
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:34,534
(mimicking female voice): "What's up, New York?"

249
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:38,033
we will be what is up New York.

250
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:45,534
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on...

251
00:02:48,100 --> 00:03:04,519
Aw, man, you guys did it, didn't you?

252
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:05,985
One thing I learned that summer

253
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:08,486
is that when love   is beginning...

254
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:09,919
(moans)

255
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:11,586
...and love is ending,

256
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:15,886
the first 30 days   are remarkably similar.

257
00:03:18,185 --> 00:03:18,252
For one thing, you spend   most of your time in bed.

258
00:03:19,452 --> 00:03:19,519
(moans)

259
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:22,452
(groans)

260
00:03:24,686 --> 00:03:24,752
Your friends can't stand   to listen to you.

261
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:29,285
He's so ticklish.

262
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:31,152
It was a really beautiful song.

263
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:35,452
So... stupid, man. (mimicking choking)

264
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:39,786
And you never seem   to wear pants.

265
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:42,819
(sighs)

266
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:43,985
Hey, Marshall.

267
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:45,819
Hey, Ted.

268
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:48,152
You hungry? What's the point?

269
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:49,219
I could eat some food.

270
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:51,219
It's just going to leave me.

271
00:03:54,085 --> 00:03:55,419
Well, at least in that scenario you get to do the dumping.

272
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:56,419
Come on, it's Sunday.

273
00:03:57,486 --> 00:03:57,552
It's pancakes day.

274
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:00,686
Lily always made the pancakes.

275
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:02,552
God, I loved her pancakes.

276
00:04:04,152 --> 00:04:04,219
So soft.

277
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:05,985
So warm.

278
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:08,486
So perfectly shaped.

279
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,919
Are we still talking about her pancakes?

280
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:14,018
Come on, you got to eat something; what can I get you?

281
00:04:15,185 --> 00:04:15,252
Beer.

282
00:04:16,786 --> 00:04:16,853
No, that's what you had for dinner.

283
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:18,586
Fine.

284
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:22,319
Then I'll just have leftovers.

285
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:23,486
BARNEY:  So, he stays home

286
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:25,919
all the time not getting laid?

287
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:27,285
No, see,

288
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:29,185
that's what you do when you have a fianc\e.

289
00:04:30,652 --> 00:04:30,719
He should be down here celebrating.

290
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:32,419
He's free.

291
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:35,385
He got that redheaded tumor removed.

292
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:38,519
You should write and illustrate children's books.

293
00:04:39,886 --> 00:04:39,953
You know what Marshall needs to do.

294
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:43,419
He needs to stop being sad.

295
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:46,819
When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead.

296
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:49,486
True story.

297
00:04:51,018 --> 00:04:51,085
It's only been a month.

298
00:04:52,886 --> 00:04:52,953
He just needs to go at his own pace.

299
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:55,152
Anyway, Lily's the one who caused this whole mess.

300
00:04:56,652 --> 00:04:56,719
Hey, cut her some slack.

301
00:04:57,985 --> 00:04:58,052
She's our friend, too.

302
00:04:59,652 --> 00:04:59,719
She's just trying to figure out who she is.

303
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:00,985
Figure out who she is?

304
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:02,886
Yeah, she should call me; I got a whole list.

305
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:03,886
She's selfish.

306
00:05:04,886 --> 00:05:04,953
She's immature.

307
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:06,285
She's...

308
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:07,385
What?

309
00:05:10,285 --> 00:05:10,352
God, your eyes are so blue.

310
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:15,219
Aw, Teddy Bear.

311
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:17,285
(mimics sword unsheathing) Oh that's a...

312
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:20,652
(groans)

313
00:05:23,252 --> 00:05:25,319
(coughs)

314
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:27,985
Yeah, it was hard to feel   too bad.

315
00:05:29,686 --> 00:05:29,752
I was dating the woman   of my dreams,

316
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:31,319
and things were going great.

317
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:32,719
Well, for the most part.

318
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:34,686
So, I found her shampoo.

319
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:36,686
MARSHALL: I guess she left it here.

320
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:40,385
It smells like her.

321
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,185
Like lavender and seashells and hope.

322
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:48,118
Somehow,

323
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:52,385
erotic and comforting all at the same time.

324
00:05:54,652 --> 00:05:54,719
That's my shampoo.

325
00:05:57,185 --> 00:05:57,252
Oh, sorry.

326
00:05:59,352 --> 00:05:59,419
Mmm, I thought he'd never go to sleep.

327
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:01,052
(moans)

328
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:02,252
Uh-oh.

329
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:05,385
Already?

330
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:07,185
He's calling her.

331
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:09,385
I don't hear any-- He's calling her.

332
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:11,786
No. (screams)

333
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:14,586
MARSHALL: Okay, you're right, I won't call her.

334
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:17,152
I will not call her.

335
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:19,085
Well, I called her.

336
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:21,586
And get this,

337
00:06:22,752 --> 00:06:22,819
she changed her number.

338
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:24,252
What, like I'm going to stalk her,

339
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:26,953
or something? Like she's so special.

340
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:29,052
Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there.

341
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:31,719
'Cause there are four others in the San Francisco area alone,

342
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:33,652
and they all seem a lot better than her

343
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:36,118
based on the brief conversations I had with them.

344
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:38,285
Does he know I'm in here?

345
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:39,519
Yeah, hey, Robin.

346
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:41,486
Anyways, one of the Lily Aldrins said...

347
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:42,619
This has to stop.

348
00:06:44,686 --> 00:06:44,752
Ted, we just started dating.

349
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:46,385
We agreed we don't want to move too fast,

350
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:48,152
and yet somehow, we have a baby.

351
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:49,352
He can't feed himself.

352
00:06:52,452 --> 00:06:52,519
He cries a lot, he keeps us up all night.

353
00:06:53,686 --> 00:06:53,752
Have you tried breast-feeding?

354
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:55,285
Nailed it!

355
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:57,886
Look, they were together nine years.

356
00:06:59,586 --> 00:06:59,652
It's only been a month and a half.

357
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:01,652
He just needs to go at his own pace.

358
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:03,953
He slept on our floor last night, Ted.

359
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:05,686
He watched a scary movie.

360
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:07,886
It is time for some tough love.

361
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:09,752
We need to get him out of that apartment.

362
00:07:11,152 --> 00:07:11,219
He needs fresh air.

363
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:12,519
He needs sunshine.

364
00:07:15,085 --> 00:07:15,152
Mmm, sunshine.

365
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:22,619
ANNOUNCER (over speaker): Please welcome to the stage, Sunshine.

366
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:25,552
All right, I really don't think this is going to help.

367
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:28,219
Do you know why you're not over Lily yet?

368
00:07:30,352 --> 00:07:30,419
It's 'cause you can still picture her naked.

369
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:32,853
You can't get over a woman until you can no longer

370
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:35,118
picture her boobs; it's a scientific fact.

371
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:38,586
The average male brain can only store a finite number

372
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:41,519
of boob images or "b-pegs".

373
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:45,819
And your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's.

374
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:47,985
There are a lot of them.

375
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:49,752
Well, they won't go away until you overwrite them

376
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:51,486
with images of other women's boobs.

377
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:52,886
Now, this journey may take

378
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:55,185
as many as a million boobs,

379
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:57,586
so we begin here tonight, my friend.

380
00:07:59,052 --> 00:07:59,118
Two at a time.

381
00:08:02,052 --> 00:08:05,752
Those count as four.

382
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:06,953
Yeah.

383
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:08,285
This is fun right?

384
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:09,985
We're outside, it's a beautiful day.

385
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:11,853
The Indians are winning.

386
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:13,419
I got to admit,

387
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:14,752
it is really nice to be outside.

388
00:08:16,118 --> 00:08:16,185
ANNOUNCER (over speaker): Yankee fans,

389
00:08:17,586 --> 00:08:17,652
please turn your attention to the Diamond Vision

390
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:20,385
for a special seventh-inning-stretch surprise.

391
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:22,486
Oh, no.

392
00:08:24,118 --> 00:08:24,185
(crowd sighing)

393
00:08:27,652 --> 00:08:29,752
(applause and cheering)

394
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:31,953
It's all a big lie!

395
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:33,619
She's just going to break your heart.

396
00:08:35,985 --> 00:08:36,052
(crowd booing)

397
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:39,419
You can drag me out of here, but she has no soul!

398
00:08:41,985 --> 00:08:42,052
We've tried everything-- baseball, strippers.

399
00:08:43,985 --> 00:08:44,052
The guy still won't eat a damn pancake.

400
00:08:45,953 --> 00:08:46,018
I think he's beyond repair.

401
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:47,752
See, this is the problem with guys.

402
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:49,452
You don't know how to deal with heartbreak.

403
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:51,819
Oh, and what's your prescription, Dr. Estrogen?

404
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:54,252
Eat Haagen-Dazs and watch Love Actually,

405
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:56,118
till your periods sync up.

406
00:08:57,752 --> 00:09:02,152
(Ted, Barney laughing)

407
00:09:03,886 --> 00:09:03,953
Yeah, that's the stuff.

408
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:05,385
Oh, my God.

409
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:07,352
How long have you been doing this?

410
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:09,452
Well, my dad taught me to me shoot when I was a kid.

411
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:12,352
Whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here,

412
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:14,085
and it reminds me that...

413
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:17,919
guns are fun.

414
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:19,486
(chuckles lightly)

415
00:09:22,486 --> 00:09:22,552
Um, you know, Ted is kind of against guns.

416
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:23,919
And that's why

417
00:09:25,352 --> 00:09:26,352
Ted's never going to find out about this.

418
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:28,285
Whoa, that sounded kind of scary

419
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:29,652
with me holding a gun, didn't it?

420
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:30,985
No, I-I just mean,

421
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:32,319
please don't tell Ted.

422
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:33,619
You want to try?

423
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:36,118
Only hell yeah.

424
00:09:39,219 --> 00:09:39,285
Oh, yeah, yeah, this is what I needed.

425
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:42,219
I felt so powerless this whole time,

426
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:44,085
but this... (laughs)

427
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:45,486
this is power.

428
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:48,953
This is... (gasps)

429
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:51,486
I should of mentioned the recoil.

430
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:53,152
I got to hand it to you, when he got home,

431
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:55,686
Marshall was smiling-- did you sleep with him?

432
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:57,586
'Cause I was actually, like, three days away

433
00:09:58,853 --> 00:09:58,919
from suggesting that.

434
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,385
Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch

435
00:10:01,452 --> 00:10:01,519
with your feminine side.

436
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:04,652
(laughing)

437
00:10:06,752 --> 00:10:06,819
Yeah, yeah!

438
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:08,285
Well, congratulations.

439
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:10,018
You're the first person to cheer him up all summer.

440
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:11,719
You win. Oh, what do I win?

441
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:12,953
I'll tell you what you win:

442
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:14,486
I'm taking you away this weekend.

443
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:15,486
You are? Mmm.

444
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:16,686
That's so nice.

445
00:10:17,886 --> 00:10:17,953
Yeah, my aunt and uncle have a beach house

446
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:19,819
out in Montauk, oh, it's really romantic.

447
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:22,118
My uncle's had like three affairs there.

448
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:23,985
Wow, must be a nice house,

449
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:25,786
I've seen pictures of your uncle.

450
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:28,219
This is going to be so great.

451
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:30,085
We'll finally get some time alone.

452
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:32,786
Are you sure Marshall's going to be okay with this?

453
00:10:34,152 --> 00:10:34,219
Yeah, absolutely.

454
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:36,118
Dude, I'm doing much better. Oh.

455
00:10:37,786 --> 00:10:37,853
In fact, take my car.

456
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:38,886
Really? Yeah.

457
00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:40,552
Hey, thanks... and, hey,

458
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:42,686
if you need anything day or night, just call me--

459
00:10:45,118 --> 00:10:45,185
You know what, please don't call me.

460
00:10:47,118 --> 00:10:47,185
What? What's wrong?

461
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:49,552
It's, uh, Lily's credit card bill.

462
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:50,886
She must have forgotten

463
00:10:51,953 --> 00:10:52,018
to switch her address.

464
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:53,419
So?

465
00:10:55,252 --> 00:10:55,319
So, I wonder what kind of charges she's making

466
00:10:56,552 --> 00:10:56,619
out there in San Francisco. No.

467
00:10:58,486 --> 00:10:58,552
No, no good can come from looking at this.

468
00:10:59,819 --> 00:10:59,886
You've made too much progress already.

469
00:11:02,118 --> 00:11:02,185
I know but I just, maybe the-- No!

470
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:06,853
You're going to thank me for this.

471
00:11:09,786 --> 00:11:10,953
You're a good friend, Ted.

472
00:11:13,385 --> 00:11:13,452
August 5th, one charge-- tickets.

473
00:11:17,352 --> 00:11:17,419
To what? George Clinton and the P-Funk All-Stars.

474
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:20,552
August 10th, one charge: Tennis Emporium.

475
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:23,486
August 18th, two charges:

476
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:29,018
Mario's Bistro and, get this, Pet Palace.

477
00:11:30,853 --> 00:11:33,486
You guys see what this means, right?

478
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:36,052
Wow, Mario's Bistro.

479
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:38,886
What a perfect place to whore around.

480
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:41,686
Only the best for my little Lily pad.

481
00:11:44,252 --> 00:11:44,319
Oh, funk legend George Clinton,

482
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:46,886
I am so glad you spotted me at your concert

483
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:51,152
and dragged me onstage to dance with you Courtney Cox-style.

484
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:53,385
And I'm so glad you agreed to play tennis with me.

485
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:54,586
Aw.

486
00:11:56,018 --> 00:11:56,085
You know, Marshall tried to get me

487
00:11:57,886 --> 00:11:57,953
to play tennis for nine years,

488
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:02,619
but I didn't do it, because I never truly loved him.

489
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:04,085
I got you a gift.

490
00:12:05,385 --> 00:12:06,419
Oh.

491
00:12:07,886 --> 00:12:07,953
A ferret.

492
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:11,853
Oh, I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace.

493
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:14,319
Oh, I've always wanted one,

494
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:17,319
but Marshall had this secret phobia of ferrets.

495
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:20,352
I bet that's something he made you promise not to tell nobody.

496
00:12:22,586 --> 00:12:22,652
(laughing): It was.

497
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:24,018
Oh.

498
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:26,652
I love you, funk legend George Clinton.

499
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:28,686
I love you, too, Lily.

500
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:30,719
That's right, Marshall, she's all mine.

501
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:32,786
Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.

502
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:34,786
* Ow, we want the funk *

503
00:12:37,252 --> 00:12:37,319
* Give up the funk... *

504
00:12:38,586 --> 00:12:38,652
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

505
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:40,252
Yeah, why are you afraid of ferrets?

506
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:41,786
They're adorable.

507
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:45,719
Because, Robin, they're like fuzzy, tube-shaped rats.

508
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:47,185
Plus, those charges are from, like, a month ago.

509
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:48,419
Exactly. For new charges,

510
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:49,886
you have to go to her online account.

511
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:55,219
You can see credit card activity from, like, two hours ago.

512
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:58,985
But, you know, don't.

513
00:13:00,786 --> 00:13:00,853
Why do you talk?

514
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:02,886
Why do you talk?!

515
00:13:04,052 --> 00:13:04,118
BARNEY: He needs her password.

516
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:05,452
It's not like he has her password.

517
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:07,686
Ooh, this is good, he has her password.

518
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:09,786
There's a charge from earlier today:

519
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:12,719
the Kellett Hotel on 5th.

520
00:13:13,953 --> 00:13:14,018
I don't believe this.

521
00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:20,201
Lily's back in New York.

522
00:13:21,144 --> 00:13:21,834
I can't believe this.

523
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:23,335
Lily's in New York?

524
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:24,868
I-I guess I've been thinking

525
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:26,502
when she got back, she'd call me.

526
00:13:28,368 --> 00:13:28,435
That's really the only reason

527
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:30,568
I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.

528
00:13:32,968 --> 00:13:33,034
This has been "holding it together"?

529
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:35,068
Okay, you know what? I'm calling her.

530
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:36,468
No. Ted, give me the phone.

531
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:37,734
You're not calling her, this changes nothing.

532
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:40,401
You, come here.

533
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:42,034
Look, while we're away this weekend, can you keep

534
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:44,235
an eye on him, make sure he doesn't call that hotel?

535
00:13:45,502 --> 00:13:45,568
You want me to babysit him?

536
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:46,934
(laughs) 20 bucks.

537
00:13:48,335 --> 00:13:48,401
An hour.

538
00:13:49,602 --> 00:13:49,667
And money for pizza.

539
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:51,235
Uh, yeah, how about you do it for free

540
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:53,268
or every time we hang out, you have to watch this?

541
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:55,001
Come here. Ooh.

542
00:13:58,034 --> 00:13:58,101
My little blue-eyed baby, baby lips. Ooh, ooh, sugar, sugar...

543
00:13:59,135 --> 00:13:59,201
Okay, I'll do it!

544
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:01,535
Stop being a couple.

545
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:03,435
Marshall. Marshall, Marshall!

546
00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:05,667
Ted, I know I shouldn't do this, but I have to! You call her

547
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:06,934
We were together for nine years! and everything we've been working so hard for

548
00:14:08,535 --> 00:14:08,602
is completely flushed down the toi...

549
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:11,235
Hello, Lily Aldrin's room, please.

550
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:12,901
Thank you. Hang up now.

551
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:14,634
Ted, I can't hang up now. Hang up now.

552
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:16,301
The missiles are in the air, and I know that you don't approve.

553
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:23,834
Hang up. Hello.

554
00:14:25,068 --> 00:14:26,268
Uh, a guy answered.

555
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,435
There's-there's a guy in her room.

556
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:30,767
I'm going down there.

557
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:31,834
BARNEY: Dude, you can't do that.

558
00:14:33,502 --> 00:14:33,568
I have to go down there, and I have

559
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:35,602
to tell her I love her; I have to beg her to take me back,

560
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:37,235
even if I have to get down on my knees.

561
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:39,068
Marshall, you can't do that. Oh, really, why not?

562
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:40,767
TED:  56 days.

563
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:43,335
That's how long it took me   to get right about here.

564
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:47,168
Because you're pathetic!

565
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:49,834
I'm sorry, but right now, you are not Marshall.

566
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,201
You are the miserable,

567
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:55,001
whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall,

568
00:14:56,468 --> 00:14:56,535
and frankly, a guy like you

569
00:14:58,268 --> 00:14:58,335
doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily.

570
00:14:59,868 --> 00:14:59,934
You know who might have a shot

571
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:01,801
somewhere down the line?

572
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:02,801
Marshall.

573
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:04,335
The real Marshall.

574
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:06,868
But if you go down there right now like this, you're going

575
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:09,968
to blow it for him, and he's never going to forgive you.

576
00:15:11,168 --> 00:15:11,235
Of course, whatever I say,

577
00:15:12,535 --> 00:15:12,602
you're just going to do the opposite,

578
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:13,634
so have a great weekend.

579
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:14,901
Good luck screwing up your life.

580
00:15:16,468 --> 00:15:17,502
Come on, Robin.

581
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,634
(clears throat)

582
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:24,301
Is it still okay if we borrow the car?

583
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:30,535
Bold. Bold to go for the car.

584
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:31,734
What?

585
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:34,101
I didn't say a thing.

586
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:35,767
You think I was too hard on him.

587
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:37,468
I didn't say a thing. (scoffs)

588
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:39,602
I can't believe you're accusing me of being too hard on him.

589
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:41,201
You're the one who said "tough love."

590
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:43,801
Yeah, tough love, not "hand the guy a noose."

591
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:45,701
Oh, but it's okay to hand him a nine millimeter?

592
00:15:48,535 --> 00:15:50,834
Yeah, he told me.

593
00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:52,568
So you're a gun nut?

594
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:55,968
No, I'm a gun enthusiast. Do you know how many people

595
00:15:57,368 --> 00:15:57,435
are killed each year The Second Amendment

596
00:15:58,535 --> 00:15:58,602
protects my right to bear arms... in accidents...

597
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:00,235
All right, all right, all right.

598
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:02,335
I was too hard on him.

599
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:04,201
A little.

600
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:05,801
(laughs softly)

601
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:09,535
I'm going to call Barney, see how they're doing.

602
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:11,235
(phone rings) Go for Barney.

603
00:16:12,268 --> 00:16:12,335
Oh, hey, where are you guys?

604
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:13,834
We're at a fundraiser,

605
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:16,101
helping young women raise money for community college.

606
00:16:17,034 --> 00:16:17,101
Strip club, nice.

607
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:18,968
Is Marshall okay? (laughs)

608
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:20,435
Yeah, he's here and he's great.

609
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:21,535
Uh, hang on. Marshall?

610
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:23,268
Tell Ted that--

611
00:16:24,968 --> 00:16:25,034
Uh-oh.

612
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:27,368
Already?

613
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:28,701
What? What uh-oh?

614
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:29,934
He's gone.

615
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:30,934
You lost him?

616
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:32,235
I can't believe this.

617
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:33,268
He's going to go down to that hotel.

618
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:34,701
Crap, you're right.

619
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:35,901
Okay, okay, here's the plan, here's the plan.

620
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:37,468
You go down to the hotel and find him.

621
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:38,834
I'll stay here and get a lap dance.

622
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:39,834
On three. One, two...

623
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:46,101
Barney!

624
00:16:48,468 --> 00:16:48,535
Was there a hot tub at your uncle's place?

625
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:54,435
A really nice one.

626
00:16:57,168 --> 00:16:58,801
Hi, uh, could you tell me what room Lily Aldrin's in?

627
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:00,468
Marshall.

628
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:03,368
(chuckling): Hey.

629
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:04,801
What happened?

630
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:07,901
Well, I went up to Lily's floor,

631
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:10,301
and I had this little speech   in my head--

632
00:17:12,235 --> 00:17:12,301
everything I've been wanting   to say to her all summer

633
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:15,901
about love, loyalty, respect.

634
00:17:19,034 --> 00:17:23,634
I knocked on the door.

635
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:26,368
So you knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?

636
00:17:27,335 --> 00:17:27,401
Yeah.

637
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:28,801
It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.

638
00:17:30,602 --> 00:17:30,667
What? Who-- who was it?

639
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:33,301
TED:  His name was Joey Adalian,   although he went by a number

640
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:36,168
of aliases in his years   as an identity thief.

641
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:39,868
Apparently,   earlier in the summer...

642
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:41,568
LILY: Oh, this is so embarrassing.

643
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:43,968
I-I could have sworn I had some change.

644
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:45,868
I know, I know.

645
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:46,968
I'm sorry.

646
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:49,734
Oh, here we go.

647
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:51,301
No, that's-that's a button.

648
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:56,034
It was a button.

649
00:17:58,034 --> 00:17:58,101
Do you, uh, take credit cards?

650
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:00,001
Yes, I do.

651
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:02,235
So Lily's not back in town,

652
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:03,268
and she doesn't have a boyfriend?

653
00:18:04,535 --> 00:18:04,602
Th-That's good news, right?

654
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:06,335
Yeah.

655
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:08,868
I don't know.

656
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:10,168
Those credit card charges

657
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:13,968
were the only remaining connection I had to her.

658
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:16,968
I don't know where she is or what she's doing.

659
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:25,502
She was my whole life, man, and now she's-she's gone.

660
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:28,468
You know, first day of college, I showed up,

661
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:29,934
I was so freaked out,

662
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:34,834
and-and I got up to my room, and there was my roommate,

663
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:37,135
lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall.

664
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:39,667
Had headphones on, big smile on his face

665
00:18:41,168 --> 00:18:42,602
like he just didn't give a crap.

666
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:43,734
Happy.

667
00:18:45,568 --> 00:18:46,602
Confident. Not afraid of anything.

668
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:49,168
That guy was you.

669
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:52,834
You before you met Lily.

670
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:54,602
Ted?

671
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:55,634
Yeah?

672
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:57,634
I was high that day.

673
00:18:58,934 --> 00:18:59,001
I was.

674
00:19:01,368 --> 00:19:03,401
I was so high, I thought you were the dean.

675
00:19:05,068 --> 00:19:05,135
Wh-What I'm saying is

676
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:07,868
there's a version of you without Lily,

677
00:19:10,468 --> 00:19:10,535
and it's not this.

678
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:13,502
You can't let Lily steal your identity

679
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:18,701
the way that guy stole hers.

680
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:20,734
Okay.

681
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:23,435
Okay, resolved.

682
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:26,235
Starting tomorrow, I'm going to start being okay.

683
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:27,602
(chuckles)

684
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,801
Cheers. Cheers.

685
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:35,435
* *

686
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:37,335
But he wasn't,

687
00:19:39,568 --> 00:19:39,634
'cause that's not   how life works.

688
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:42,335
The next day, he found one   of her socks or something,

689
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:46,734
and we were back to square one.

690
00:19:48,602 --> 00:19:48,667
And then, one morning...

691
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:52,068
Ted, I think you should see this.

692
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,068
Oh, no, what now?

693
00:19:58,301 --> 00:19:58,368
Marshall, what are you doing?

694
00:19:59,502 --> 00:19:59,568
It's Sunday.

695
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:06,258
It's pancakes day.

696
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:07,554
It took him 67 days

697
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:14,987
and one really disgusting   batch of pancakes...

698
00:20:16,154 --> 00:20:16,221
So good.

699
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:18,954
Mmm. So good.

700
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:21,755
...but Marshall had come back   from the dead.

701
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:24,688
Because while baseball,   strippers, and guns can help,

702
00:20:28,221 --> 00:20:28,287
the only thing that can really   heal a broken heart is time.

703
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:31,321
* I try to laugh about it *

704
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:35,855
* Cover it all up with lies *

705
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:39,654
* I try to laugh about it *

706
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:42,521
* Hiding the tears from my eyes *

707
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:55,721
* 'Cause boys don't cry. *
